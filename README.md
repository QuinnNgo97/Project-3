# AdventureWorks Product Performance Dashboard
## Project Background

The Product Manager at AdventureWorks has requested a new approach to internet sales reporting, transitioning from static reports to dynamic, visual dashboards. They seeks a comprehensive understanding of product performance, including insights into product sales, regional preferences, and trends over time.

Key requirements include:

1. **Sales Overview Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard providing a summary of internet sales between June of 2012 and May of 2014.
2. **Performance**: Visualization of sales performance, with a focus on trends over the past two years.
3. **Product Insights**: A detailed view of internet sales by products, highlighting top/bottom sellers.
4. **Filtering Options**: The ability to filter data by product, region, and time (year or month).

An interactive PowerBI dashboard can be downloaded [here]().

The SQL code utilized to clean, organize and prepare data for the dashboard can be found [here](https://github.com/QuinnNgo97/Project-AdventureWorks-Sales-Performance/blob/51f055ad11856f4aa0e4d5948b10530b33932f65/AdventureWorks%20Products%20Analysis.sql).

The 2022 AdventureWorks dataset for perfoming this analysis can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms).

# Data Structure & Initial Checks
